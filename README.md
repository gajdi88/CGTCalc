# Capitacl Gains Tax Calc
This is to help calculate capital gains tax on stock transactions

## Requirements
- Upload CSVs from downloaded investment account transactions
- Maintain a "ledger" database of transactions and CGT projection
- Ledger should be easily editable and easy to understand - which stock got bought at what time.
- CGT calculation should be visualised

### Nice to haves
- When uploading CSVs, preview what changes it will make to the ledger.

## Design choices
- Python backend for quick iterations
- Very basic DB to get started quickly - CSV
